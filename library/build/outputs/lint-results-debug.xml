        id="RecyclerView"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Do not treat position as fixed; only use immediately and call `viewHolder.getAdapterPosition()` to look it up later"

        priority="8"
        summary="RecyclerView Problems"
        explanation="`RecyclerView` will *not* call `onBindViewHolder` again when the position of the item changes in the data set unless the item itself is invalidated or the new position cannot be determined.

For this reason, you should *only* use the position parameter while acquiring the related data item inside this method, and should *not* keep a copy of it.

If you need the position of an item later on (e.g. in a click listener), use `getAdapterPosition()` which will have the updated adapter position."

        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"
